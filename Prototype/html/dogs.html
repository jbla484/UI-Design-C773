      <h1>Activity Needs for Dogs</h1>

      <p>
        The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a diverse variety of
        choices as there are well over 300 breeds recognized by the World Canine
        Organization. Adopting a dog offers mutual benefits between dog and owner. Many
        studies cite the social benefits of having a companion as well as the reduced
        feelings of loneliness from adopting a dog. Studies even show medical indicators
        such as reduced blood pressure and improved lipid profiles. If you have a dog,
        it is important to make sure that you care for your dog; be mindful of what you
        feed your dog and provide enough opportunities for exercise. In this page, you
        will find more information about how to care for your pets throughout the various
        stages of their lives.
      </p>

      <h3>Diet & Exercise</h3>

      <p>
        Throughout dogs’ lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals as they
        mature. Puppies should be nursed the first two months, then introduced to three
        meals per day when they are about three to six months years old. Their food intake
        should be reduced to two meals per day when they are six months to one year old
        and finally reduced to one meal after they reach one year old. And a dog’s typical
        body mass is composed of somewhere between 60 and 70 percent water. The ASPCA
        says just a 10 percent decrease in body water can cause illness, and a 15 percent
        loss can cause death, so make sure you keep your pooch hydrated!
      </p>

      <p>
        Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity to keep their organs
        healthy, as well as sun and fresh air. The minimum recommended time for exercise
        varies greatly with breed and size differences, but generally a range of 30–120
        minutes of exercise is recommended per day! Can you imagine exercising two hours per
        day? OK, I know that wouldn't bother some of you reading this. But the thought of
        it to me makes me cringe! And by the way, exercising your dog does not mean you are
        being challenged to a push-up contest. Brisk walks are OK too! You can also choose
        from a variety of toys to encourage physical activity; just be sure they are age
        appropriate and do not pose a choking hazard. Pay careful attention to toys that
        require supervision.
      </p>

      <h3>Grooming & Handling</h3>

      <p>
        Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. So be sure to
        brush frequently to reduce the amount of shedding and prevent matted and tangled
        fur that can prove to be extremely difficult to remove. Check for insects such
        as ticks and fleas, especially after visiting heavily wooded areas. Bathing is not
        only important to your dog’s health but can be an exercise depending on how strong
        willed the dog is. Rinse all of the soap out, as any residual soap can result in
        a rash. Be sure the soap is formulated for your puppy or dog, since harsh soaps
        can cause allergic reactions. And as always, be careful how you handle your loved
        one. No matter the size of your dog, you need to be cautious as you carry your
        canine. If you have a small dog, then cradle the pup with one hand under the chest
        and the forearm supporting the back half. If it is a large dog, reach under the
        belly with both your arms perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm to support
        the chest and rear as you lift.
      </p>

      <h3>Vaccinations & Medications</h3>

      <p class="lastpara">
        You should always consult with your veterinarian, but there is a core set of
        vaccines that are typically recommended. Vaccines that reduce the exposure risk
        to things such as hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus. Others may be determined by
        your vet depending on the environment in which the dog resides. Some of these
        include Bordetella bronchiseptica, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Leptospira bacteria.
