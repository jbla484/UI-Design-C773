# UI-Design-C773

This is my final project for my user interface design class, labeled C773 on my degree program through WGU. It included making a detailed project proposal with strategies by defining how the current website structure didn't meet the needs of the users and stakeholders. I produced a sitemap and wireframe of the redesign, with a document describing the information architecture, primary and secondary navigational elements, needed micro interactions and functionality, and a detailed maintenance plan for maintaining the needs of the users and stakeholders.

I produced a prototype for the second part of the project, making sure to incorporate my prior deliverables to meet the required needs. The code I wrote for the redesign will be in this repository.
